## Abstract

Existing score-based adversarial attacks mainly focus on crafting \topK{1} adversarial examples against classifiers with single-label classification. Their attack success rate and query efficiency are often less than satisfactory, particularly under small perturbation requirements; moreover, the vulnerability of classifiers with multi-label learning is yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive surrogate free score-based attack, named \b geometric \b score-based \b black-box \b attack (\GSBAK{K}), to craft adversarial examples in an aggressive \topK{K} setting for both untargeted and targeted attacks, where the goal is to change the \topK{K} predictions of the target classifier. We introduce novel gradient-based methods to find a good initial boundary point to attack. Our iterative method employs novel gradient estimation techniques, particularly effective in \topK{K} setting, on the decision boundary to effectively exploit the geometry of the decision boundary. Additionally, \GSBAK{K} can be used to attack against classifiers with \topK{K} multi-label learning. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets validate the effectiveness of \GSBAK{K} in crafting \topK{K} adversarial examples.
